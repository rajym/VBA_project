1.  Introduction
   
The Automated Invoice System is designed to simplify the process of generating, managing, and recording invoices. It helps businesses maintain an organized record of customer details and invoices while enabling the export of invoices in both XLS and PDF formats. The system improves workflow efficiency by automating common tasks, such as adding new customers and maintaining historical invoice data.

2. System Features
   
2.1 Add a New Customer
Description: This feature allows users to add new customer information, including the customer's name, contact details, billing address, and unique customer ID. Once added, the customer details are stored and can be referenced when creating new invoices.

2.2 Generate and Save Invoice
Description: This feature allows the user to generate invoices based on selected customer details and items/services provided. The system then saves the invoice in both XLS (Excel) and PDF formats for easy access and sharing.

2.3 Record of Invoices
Description: The system automatically keeps a record of all generated invoices for easy access and auditing. The record includes detailed information about the invoices, such as invoice number, customer name, date, and the total amount.
